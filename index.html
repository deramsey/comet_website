                <p>Description: Students today have access to AI tools that can write for them, take lecture notes, summarize readings, brainstorm ideas, and even ‚Äúlearn‚Äù for them‚Ä¶but should they use these tools? This session will explore how generative AI (GenAI) technologies work, the ethical considerations of using these technologies for teaching and learning, and how to design academic integrity policies that demonstrate an informed position on GenAI use in the classroom.
